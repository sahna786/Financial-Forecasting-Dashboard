# Financial-Forecasting-Dashboard
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of key sales and financial metrics, including year-over-year growth, sales by country, product performance, and segment profitability. Here’s a detailed look at each section.

## Project Objective
To analyze and visualize key sales metrics to support data-driven decision-making. 

Key Focus Area
- Sales performance over time
- Profitability by country, segment, and product
- Discount trends and impact on profits

## Problem Statements
1. What is the total sales revenue compared to the previous year?
2. How many orders were placed this year versus last year?
3. Which countries contribute the most to our overall sales?
4. Which countries have the highest and lowest profit percentages?
5. What is the distribution of discounts across different discount bands?
6. What are the top three products by sales volume?
7. Which products are driving the most revenue in each customer segment?
8. How does product performance vary across different regions?
9. Which months or periods had the highest sales growth?
10. Which customer segments are experiencing the most growth or decline in profit?

## Methodologies Used in the Project
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
- Gathered raw sales and financial data from multiple sources.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency using tools like Excel and SQL.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed key metrics such as sales, orders, profit, and discounts across time, regions, products, and segments.
- Identified trends, patterns, and outliers to understand data behavior.

3. Data Modeling and Transformation:
- Used SQL for data transformation and aggregation to derive meaningful insights.
- Created calculated fields (e.g., profit margin, discount percentages) to support deeper analysis.

4. Data Visualization:
- Designed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to present insights visually.
- Used charts, tables, and filters for better stakeholder engagement and understanding.

5. Performance Metrics Evaluation:
- Tracked KPIs such as total sales, profit percentage, and order volumes to evaluate business performance.

6. Insight Generation and Strategy Development:
- Generated actionable insights for optimizing pricing, enhancing profitability, and focusing on high-performing regions and products.

7. Iterative Design Process:
- Incorporated feedback from stakeholders to refine the dashboard and ensure usability.


## Sales Performance Analysis
1. Current Sales Trend:
- The total sales for the current period stand at 92.31 million, showing a substantial year-over-year increase of 240.49%. This indicates a strong upward trend in sales performance, suggesting effective sales strategies and increased demand.

2. Order Volume Growth:
- The total number of orders has reached 861,132, representing a significant increase of 225.36% from the previous year. This rise in order volume aligns with the growth in sales revenue and highlights successful customer acquisition or retention efforts.

3. Top Performing Regions:
- Canada and France lead in order volume, with 247K and 241K orders respectively, followed closely by the United States with 233K orders. These countries are key contributors to overall sales, and further efforts in these regions could amplify growth.

4. Profitability:
- The current profit margin is 14.10%, slightly down from 14.68% in the previous year. Despite the overall sales growth, the marginal decline in profit percentage suggests that either increased costs or higher discounting may be impacting profitability.

5. Sales Distribution by Product:
- The top three products—Paseo (33M in sales), VTT (21M), and Velo (18M)—are driving a significant portion of revenue. These products appear to be customer favorites and could be strategically prioritized in marketing or sales campaigns.

6. Discount Analysis:
- The total discount amount stands at 7.06 million, marking a 220.04% increase over the prior year. The majority of discounts fall into the High category (57.76%), which, while encouraging sales, might be affecting the overall profit margin.

7. Monthly Sales Trends:
- The sales trend over the year shows some fluctuations, suggesting potential seasonality. The highest peaks in sales might correspond to key shopping seasons or promotional periods, which could be leveraged in future campaigns.

8. Opportunities for Improvement:
- While sales and orders are growing, the slight decline in profit margin points to an opportunity to optimize pricing or discount strategies. Additionally, focusing on high-profit regions and segments could further enhance overall profitability.

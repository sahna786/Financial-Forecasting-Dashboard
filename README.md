## Methodology
## Sales Performance Analysis
1. Current Sales Trend:
- The total sales for the current period stand at 92.31 million, showing a substantial year-over-year increase of 240.49%. This indicates a strong upward trend in sales performance, suggesting effective sales strategies and increased demand.

2. Order Volume Growth:
- The total number of orders has reached 861,132, representing a significant increase of 225.36% from the previous year. This rise in order volume aligns with the growth in sales revenue and highlights successful customer acquisition or retention efforts.
Top Performing Regions:

Canada and France lead in order volume, with 247K and 241K orders respectively, followed closely by the United States with 233K orders. These countries are key contributors to overall sales, and further efforts in these regions could amplify growth.
Profitability:

The current profit margin is 14.10%, slightly down from 14.68% in the previous year. Despite the overall sales growth, the marginal decline in profit percentage suggests that either increased costs or higher discounting may be impacting profitability.
Sales Distribution by Product:

The top three products—Paseo (33M in sales), VTT (21M), and Velo (18M)—are driving a significant portion of revenue. These products appear to be customer favorites and could be strategically prioritized in marketing or sales campaigns.
Discount Analysis:

The total discount amount stands at 7.06 million, marking a 220.04% increase over the prior year. The majority of discounts fall into the High category (57.76%), which, while encouraging sales, might be affecting the overall profit margin.
Monthly Sales Trends:

The sales trend over the year shows some fluctuations, suggesting potential seasonality. The highest peaks in sales might correspond to key shopping seasons or promotional periods, which could be leveraged in future campaigns.
Opportunities for Improvement:

While sales and orders are growing, the slight decline in profit margin points to an opportunity to optimize pricing or discount strategies. Additionally, focusing on high-profit regions and segments could further enhance overall profitability.
